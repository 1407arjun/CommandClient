## Notes:
### Modules:
The following modules were used for the server (whose files haven't been uploaded):
1. express
2. body-parser
3. child_process

### What's implemented:
1. Commands can be sent to the server for execution.
2. Biometric auth and PIN has been added (PIN=1234).
3. Server can be connected to the Android client using the IPv4 and port number.

### What's not implemented:
1. Couldn't get a response back from the server.
2. Faced a bit of difficulty in implemeting without using Callbacks (reading more about that).
3. Not sure if the current implemetation using await, async is the ideal one or not.
